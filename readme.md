# Use Case: Real-Time Stock Market Data Processing
## Architecture Overview

1. Data Source: real-time stock price data
2. Kafka Cluster: Streams stock data to a Kafka topic.
3. Consumer (PySpark Structured Streaming): Reads data from Kafka and processes stock trends.
4. Data Storage: Stores results in AWS S3 (raw data) and Redshift (processed data).
5. Visualization: Uses QuickSight or Grafana to visualize stock trends.

## Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Setup Kafka Cluster
    Install and configure Kafka on your local machine.
    Create a Kafka topic (stock_prices).
2. Pull Real-Time Data Producer
    Write a Python script to pull and send fake stock price data to Kafka.
    Use kafka-python or confluent-kafka to push messages.
3. Stream Processing with PySpark
    Use Structured Streaming to consume Kafka messages.
    Perform real-time transformations (e.g., moving average, anomaly detection).
    Store raw data in S3 and processed insights in postgresql.
4. Deploy to AWS
    Use Amazon MSK (Managed Kafka) to scale.
    Store streaming results in S3 (raw data) and Redshift (aggregated trends).
    Automate using AWS Lambda or Glue Jobs.
5. Visualize in Grafana / QuickSight
    Connect Redshift to QuickSight or use Grafana for real-time dashboards.
    Show stock price trends, moving averages, and volume analysis.
