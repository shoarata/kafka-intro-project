# Real-time Log Processing and Alerting System

### Overview:

    Build a real-time log processing pipeline that ingests system/application logs, processes them using Kafka, and generates alerts for anomalies.

### Tech Stack:

    Kafka (for message streaming)
    Python (to produce and consume messages using confluent-kafka or kafka-python)
    PySpark / Flink (for stream processing)
    PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch (for storing processed logs)
    Grafana / Kibana (for visualization & monitoring)
    AWS S3 / Kafka Connect (optional: for long-term storage)

### Project Steps:

1. Log Generator (Producer)
    Create a Python script that generates fake system logs (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
    Push logs to a Kafka topic (logs_raw)
2. Kafka Consumer & Stream Processing
    Consume logs from logs_raw
    Parse and categorize log messages
    Filter out ERROR or WARNING messages to a new Kafka topic (logs_alerts)
3. Store & Analyze Logs
    Save structured logs in PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch
    Use Grafana/Kibana to visualize trends
4. Real-time Alerting System
    Set up a Kafka consumer that listens to logs_alerts
    Trigger an alert (email, Slack, or webhook) when error frequency exceeds a threshold
### Bonus Enhancements:
    Implement Kafka Connect to store logs in AWS S3
    Use Apache Flink for advanced stream processing
    Deploy the solution with Docker & Kubernetes
